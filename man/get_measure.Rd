\title{Get measure value along Oregon DEQ's NHDH_OR_931v220.}
\usage{
get_measure(pid, x, y, max_length = 25, return_sf = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pid}{The NHD Permanent_Identifier value as a string.}

\item{x}{The longitude in decimal degrees.}

\item{y}{The latitude in decimal degrees.}

\item{max_length}{The maximum segment length in meters to split the NHD reach into. Default is 25 meters. Passed to \link{split_lines}. The smaller the distance the longer the operation takes.}

\item{return_sf}{Boolean. A TRUE value will return the sf object with data frame columns for GNIS_Name, Permanent_Identifier, ReachCode, and Measure.
FALSE will return the measure value as a character. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
sf object with data frame columns for Permanent_Identifier, ReachCode, measure, and snap_distance
}
\description{
The function will query Oregon DEQ's NHD feature service to determine the measure value along a target NHD flowline. The Permanent Identifier (pid) is
used to select a specific reach from the feature service. The x and y coordinates are snapped to the nearest vertex on the selected flowline and the measure value determined.
If return_sf=TRUE the sf is projected into ESPG:4326 (WGS84) which is the expected default for \code{\link[leaflet]{leaflet}}.
}
\details{
This function is intended to be a helper function for \code{\link{launch_map}} although it may be used independently as well.

The feature service can be accessed at \url{https://arcgis.deq.state.or.us/arcgis/rest/services/WQ/NHDH_ORDEQ/MapServer/1}
